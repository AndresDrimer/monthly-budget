Ideas for next version: 
- it may update dolarblue rate with date changes...
- maybe when used in English it may perform different about dollar blue, it makes no sense abroad from Argentina... but it can drive to some mess if same account changes, because it is going to reflected differnt on DB.
- consult for table show prevents itself from being directed as a prepared statment, maybe can be improved in future. Same for INNER JOIN dolarblue consult on Stats.
- it may have dedicated folders to separate .php files form .js (althought there are only 5 .js files at present time)
